# matrix-calculator
The program performs the following operations with matrices:

1.	Addition
2.	Subtraction
3.	Multiplication
4.	Multiplication by a scalar
5.	Transposition
6.	Matrix inverse
7.	Determinant
8.	LU decomposition
9.	PLU decomposition
10.	RREF

All operations are performed according to the rules of linear algebra. Before the operation, the program checks whether it is possible to perform the operation selected by the user for the entered matrices.

**An example of program usage:**
